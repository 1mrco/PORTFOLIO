# 🚀 Quick GitHub Setup in Cursor

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to **github.com** and sign in
2. Click **"+"** → **"New repository"**
3. Name: `portfolio` (or your choice)
4. **Don't** initialize with README
5. Click **"Create repository"**

## Step 2: Copy Your Repository URL

After creating, GitHub shows you a URL like:
- `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/portfolio.git`

**Copy this URL** - we'll use it next!

## Step 3: In Cursor

Once you have the repository URL, I can help you:
1. Add the remote
2. Push all your code
3. Set up deployment

## What I'll Do

After you give me the repository URL, I'll run:
```bash
git remote add origin YOUR_REPO_URL
git push -u origin main
```

Then we'll deploy to Vercel!
